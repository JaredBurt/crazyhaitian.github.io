				As a first generation American, Nancy acquired her passion for cooking food from her grandmother Proxelia Poliard. Living to 102, Proxelia shared her own Haitian cuisines as well as the wonderful variety of foods New York has to offer. In addition, Nancy is well traveled as a military spouse, having tasted foods from all over the world! She has dreamt of having her own restaurant for a long time.
